# Contact tracing and Consent: why using TraceTogether is different from using your memory

I'm working on a third blog post that will look more carefully at the details of TraceTogether with the Australian context in mind, expanding on [some thoughts I tweeted](https://twitter.com/VTeagueAus/status/1251024530836873216?s=20) already.

In the  [first](blog/2020-03-30TweakingTracetogether.md) 
and [second](blog/2020-04-07ContactTracingWithoutSurveillance.md) I recommended that Australia should adopt a decentralized alternative to TraceTogether in order to reduce the risk of mistakes or abuse of the data.
